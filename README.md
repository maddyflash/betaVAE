# betaVAE
Group 5 [beta VAE](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sy2fzU9gl) paper reproduction assignment.

# Data

The weights and data used in this experiment can be downloaded from the [releases](https://github.com/maddyflash/betaVAE/releases)
page. Place the downloaded weights in to the data folder of this repository and unzip them: the scripts expect to find
these weights there.

# Reproducing results

The scripts and notebooks to regenerate the results are provided in this repository in the form of Python scripts and notebooks. Most of
the generated data can be found in the data folder except for the trained weights, which can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/maddyflash/betaVAE/releases).

We recommend using conda to re-create our environment by running the following command:

`conda create -n <env-name> --file requirements.txt`
